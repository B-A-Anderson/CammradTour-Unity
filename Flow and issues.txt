Flow:
The first scene would scan a qrcode and receive the key from it. Clicking the button will take you to the second scene.
The app should then use the key and search for the file path of the obj file with the same name in the phone's storage with a function named FindFile() in the ObjFromFile class
["\storage\emulated\0\Download" this is the directory will be in the phone and the function will target there]
(this part will be later changed but for test purpose this is what will be done)
After this, it will use that file path to present that 3D model and show the path at the top.
There is a button at the bottom that will take you back to the first scene.

Issues:
The QRCodeScanner class goes to the first scene and works perfectly

The Display class and ObjFromFile class is for the second scene.

The camera from the display class works good but for some reason every thing else doesn't. The button is unresponsive and doesn't go back to the first scene
and the TextMeshPro doesn't change the text to display the file path.

The ObjFromFile class is for loadiing the obj model into the scene. It's a part of a package I downloaded and there's a statement that loads the 3D model

loadedObject = new OBJLoader().Load(objPath);

I tested the package seperately and it works perfectly there, but for some reason it is not doing that in the scene.
